#+TITLE: Ray tracing, once again
#+DATE: 2011-01-23

There are already several implementations of simple raytracers in
Clojure on the Web but I couldn't resist implementing one for myself! It
is based on the one of the book Ansi Common Lisp by Paul Graham.

Nothing particular, just perhaps the use of protocols for the dispatch
of the normal, color and intersect functions and some code for
displaying spirals.
