* Pros
- much more flexible and powerful than many modern languages such as Python
- best in class ability to develop a program interactively with a powerful REPL  

* Cons
- lack of libraries
- most standard datastructures are mutable
- nil comes everywhere, much more often than in Elixir for example which is also dynamic
