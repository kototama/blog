#+TITLE: Implementing a Lisp
#+DATE: 2012-05-02
#+TAGS: c lisp

To extend my knowledge and to have a better understanding of the Lisp's
foundations, I implemented a simple Lisp in C. It supports symbols,
integers, a few primitives, anonymous functions, closures, macros and
garbage collection. The implementation follows the KISS principles and
is around 1400 lines of code.

Hey, cool project. I just started something similar, here:
https://github.com/deliciousrobots/lisp . I'm intrigued by your
implementation of garbage collection... an area I punted on (just using
Boehm's GC), but eventually would like to implement myself. I'll be
reading through your code for inspiration and comparison, so far I like
what I'm seeing. You can email me (steveth45 at the google mail
service).
