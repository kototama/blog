#+TITLE: An Emacs minor mode for the ClojureScript
#+DATE: 2012-10-18
#+TAGS: emacs-lisp clojurescript

When programming with ClojureScript, one has to lunch *"lein cljsbuild
auto"* to automatically compiles its ClojureScript sources. It is
convenient but a problem remains: the output of the compilation process
must be manually read to see if any errors or warnings occur.

To solve this problem I programmed a simple minor mode for Emacs. If you
start the *cljsbuild* command in a terminal buffer, it will watch the
ouput and popup the window if an error or a warning occurs. It can also
automatically hide the process when the compilation succeed, so that you
are able to concentrate on what matters, the code.

It's available on [[http://marmalade-repo.org/][Marmalade]] or

Feedback and patches are welcomed!
