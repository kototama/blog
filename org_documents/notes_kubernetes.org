* Concepts

** Pods

The execution environment running containers. Usually one pod runs one container but sometimes more ("sidecar" container).

** Deployments

Controller that manages the pod. Starts all the pods at the same time.
Self-healing, scaling, rollouts, and rollbacks.

** Services

Route traffic to the selected pods

** Ingress
Reverse HTTP proxy.
- NodePort services works on high ports number only.
- LoadBalancer have a 1:1 mapping from LoadBalancer to a service, so one LoadBalancer is needed per service!

** Service discovery

- Automatic. ClusterDNS registers a new A and SRV records when a new Service is created. SRV record have IP and
a PORT.
- ClusterIPs are on a separate network, no route to it
- ClusteIP service named kube-dns listen on port 53
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Virtual_Server][IPVS (IP Virtual Server)]] is used

** Storage

- Container Storage Interface (CSI) provides a common interface for storage providers
- PersistentVolumes (PV), PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC), StorageClasses (SC)
- topology-aware provisioning is achieved when a PV is created only upon a Pod creation instead of before

** ConfigMaps
- environment variables or files in a volume (or command-line arguments to the container)

** StatefulSets

- Persistent Pod names and DNS names, volume bindings
- Pods created and destroyed one at a time by default (can be changed), useful for some services like distributed databases
- Headless Service = a Service without a ClusterIP
- An Headless Service + StatefulSet = Governing Service
- Governing service creates DNS entries SRV and A for matching (label selector) pods

** Security

- authentification: client certificate or IAM solutions
- RBAC. Deny by default.
- Mutating and validating admission controllers: they intercept the requests

** Kubernetes API

- general available (GA) resources that get deprecated are valid for 12 months or 3 releases before being phased out
- custom resources can be created with a custom controller, allowing to extend the Kubernetes API

** Security Hardening
- ~automountServiceAccountToken: false~ for pods that don't need to communicate with the API server
- Pod Security Standards (PSS): privileged, baseline or restricted. Implemented as validating admission controllers.
- ~kube-bench~
* Commands
- ~kubectl api-resources~
* Components
Control plane:
- kube-apiserver (~kubectl~ command makes request to it)
- etcd
- kube-scheduler: schedule pods at specific locations
- kube-controller-manager: core processes
Worker nodes:
- container runtimes
- kubelet  
* Solutions
** For on-premises
Google Anthos, Rancher, RedHat OpenShift, Canonical Kubernetes
** Locally
Minikube, K3s, OpenShift Local
* NixOS and Minikube

Starting ~minikube start~ with default docker fails but using podman ~virtualisation.podman.enable = true;~
with ~virtualisation.podman.enable = true;~ works.
