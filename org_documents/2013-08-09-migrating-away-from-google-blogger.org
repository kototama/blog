#+TITLE: Migrating away from Google Blogger

This blog is moving away from Google Blogger. Update your RSS reader.

Moving to a self-hosted platform will allow me to:

- have a better control of my data. My blog can now be versioned on GitHub and do not depend of Google anymore.
- have a better workflow. I can now blog in plain text with Emacs, [[http://octopress.org][Octopress]] and [[https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress][org-octopress]].

Of course the reliability may not be as good as the Google
services but in general I think I will enjoy the journey!
