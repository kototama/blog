In this post I will show you how I conceived a beautifull laser-cutted wooden cube.

The first step I took was to conceive a 3D model of the cube to ensure
that each piece fit well when assembled. I wanted to used open-source
tools so I used the [[http://www.freecadweb.org/][FreeCAD]] software, which was unfortunately buggy.
Undo/redo was not working properly (tip for the developpers of
FreeCAD: use immutable data-structures!) so I used Git for
snapshotting the model in case anything went wrong. Each face of the
cube was then projected on a plan inside FreeCAD. You can find the
final work [[https://github.com/kototama/laser-cutting-cube][here]]. There are already existing tools and websites to
conceived such wooden cubes or boxes with laser-cutters but I wanted
to do everything myself.

The second step was to edit the files in Inkscape to add the letters
and specify the cutting, engraving and marking areas with different
colors.

The third step was to import the file in [[https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/visicut][VisiCut]] and map the color to
the laser operations and adjust the settings. Different laser cutters
models have different software requirements.

The fourth step was to calibrate the laser. This is not as hard as it
sounds. Basically you just need to adjust the distance between the
laser head and the wood. It is easy to do after somebody explain it to
you.

The fifth step was to do a few experiments on the laser cutter to get
the setting right. For example the first trial did not cut through the
wood, then the intensity of the marking was not good enough etc.
Playing with the speed and the power of the laser allows to get
different results.

How does a laser-cutter looks like? Look on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AzZlFRRGU][YouTube]].

This is the cube once cutted and assembled (without glue):

It makes a really nice present:

You can get access to laser cutters at your local FabLab / Maker-Space / Hacker-Space.
