<p>
In this post I introduce a simple, effective and maintainable
structure for the <code>.emacs.d</code> configuration directory.
</p>

<p>
I have a mix feeling about pre-defined Emacs configurations such are
<a href="https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live">Emacs Live</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Prelude</a>. In one hand they build a nice showcase,
demonstrating powerful modes and features, in the other hand they seem
complex in their structure and use their own abstractions ("modules"
for Prelude, "pack" for Emacs Live). That is why I still prefer to
write my own configuration which I can easily fix. Of course I still
dig in people configuration to get ideas. Basically I have reached the
same conclusion as <a href="https://github.com/technomancy">technomancy</a> which stopped its <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">Emacs Starter Kit</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the last weeks I have redone my configuration removing <a href="https://github.com/dimitri/el-get">El-Get</a>,
which I found too slow, in favor of <a href="http://melpa.milkbox.net/">MELPA</a>. My initial switch to El-Get
was because <a href="http://marmalade-repo.org/">Marmalade</a> was often down ; I didn't experience the same
issues with MELPA.
</p>

<p>
The configuration is based on <a href="https://github.com/zenspider/package">package+</a> (the name is hard to search on
the web!) and the great <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package">use-package</a> package. A <code>makefile</code> installs the
few git submodules needed, download user-defined packages and
byte-compiles the packages. User and machines specific configurations
can be defined in the <code>$HOME/.eroles/login@hostname/</code> directory. The
<code>auto-async-byte-compile</code> mode ensures that Emacs Lisp files are
always byte-compiled.
</p>

<p>
All packages configurations are done in a lazy way, thanks to
use-package, and organized with <code>orgstruct-mode</code> in an org-like
structure.
</p>

<p>
I stole a few ideas <a href="https://github.com/magnars">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/technomancy">there</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley">there</a> for the configuration.
</p>

<p>
The configuration is simple yet effective, I hope it can inspire
beginners or even advanced users for how to structure an <code>.emacs.d</code>
directory effectively.

See my <a href="https://github.com/kototama/.emacs.d">.emacs.d configuration on GitHub</a> and happy hacking!
