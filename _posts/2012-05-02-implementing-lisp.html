To extend my knowledge and to have a better understanding of the Lisp's foundations, I implemented a simple Lisp in C. It supports symbols, integers, a few primitives, anonymous functions, closures, macros and garbage collection. The implementation follows the KISS principles and is around 1400 lines of code. <br><br><br>Discussion: <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3919685">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3919685</a><br>Code: <a href="https://github.com/kototama/kml">https://github.com/kototama/kml</a><br></div>

Hey, cool project. I just started something similar, here: https://github.com/deliciousrobots/lisp . I&#39;m intrigued by your implementation of garbage collection... an area I punted on (just using Boehm&#39;s GC), but eventually would like to implement myself. I&#39;ll be reading through your code for inspiration and comparison, so far I like what I&#39;m seeing. You can email me (steveth45 at the google mail service).</div>
