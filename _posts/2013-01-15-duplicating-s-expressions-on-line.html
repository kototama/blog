<p>Duplicating a line is extremely useful when editing text and specially when programming. There is no native command in Emacs to achieve that but <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/88399/how-do-i-duplicate-a-whole-line-in-emacs">it's easy to add one</a>. </p> <p>It's easy to get addicted to the use of this new command but a problem remains when programming in Lisp with <a href="http://emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit">paredit.el</a>: duplicating sometimes lead to invalid s-expressions being inserted.  </p> <p>I decided to give it a try and made an implementation that duplicate the s-expressions after the point (cursor).  For instance in Clojure if you are editing this code: <pre class="brush: clojure" name="code">(ns myns<br />  (:use [clojure.string :only [escape]]))<br /></pre> You can duplicate the first vector by placing the cursor on the square bracket, invoking the command with one keystroke and then easily obtain this code: <pre class="brush: clojure" name="code">(ns myns<br />  (:use [clojure.string :only [escape]]<br />        [clojure.set :only [union]]))<br /></pre> Here is the code to duplicate the line; to my knowledge there is no such command in <a href="http://emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit">paredit.el</a>: <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/4538617.js"></script></p>Not really pretty but it does the work, feel free to provide a nicer implementation in the comments or add it to your ~/.emacs.d/init.el file with:  <pre class="brush: clojure" name="code"><br />(eval-after-load "paredit"<br />  '(progn (define-key paredit-mode-map (kbd "C-S-d") 'paredit-duplicate-after-point)))<br /></pre> <b>Edit:</b> <a href="https://github.com/kototama/.emacs.d/blob/master/elisp/setup-lisp.el#L51">Here a fix</a> for when the sexp is the last expression in the buffer.  </p></div>

Nice idea. Have you tried expand-region ? It doesn&#39;t do quite what you&#39;re trying here, but it handles most of the &#39;sexp that straddles a line ending issues&#39; </div>
