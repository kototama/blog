<div class='post'>
<p>When programming with ClojureScript, one has to lunch <b>"lein cljsbuild auto"</b> to automatically compiles its ClojureScript sources. It is convenient but a problem remains: the output of the compilation process must be manually read to see if any errors or warnings occur. </p> <p>To solve this problem I programmed a simple minor mode for Emacs. If you start the <b>cljsbuild</b> command in a terminal buffer, it will watch the ouput and popup the window if an error or a warning occurs. It can also automatically hide the process when the compilation succeed, so that you are able to concentrate on what matters, the code. </p> <p>It's available on <a href="http://marmalade-repo.org/">Marmalade</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kototama/cljsbuild-mode">Github</a>.  </p> <p>Feedback and patches are welcomed! </p></div>
