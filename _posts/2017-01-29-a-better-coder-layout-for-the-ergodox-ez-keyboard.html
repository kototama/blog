I'm a happy owner of the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">ErgoDox EZ</a>, an awesome ergonomic
mechanical keyboard. The Ergodox can be configured with multiple
<b>layers</b>. The first layer is generally configured to be the one with
the letters and symbols used for the standard layout (like QWERTY, AZERTY,
or Colemak). Often the second layer is the so-called "coder" layer with
symbols for programming such as parenthesis, brackets, semi-brackets
etc. The third one can be configured to control the mouse and the
multimedia functions of the operating system with the keyboard.
Everything is configurable and additional layouts can be added with an
<a href="http://configure.ergodox-ez.com/">online configurator</a> or by compiling a C file for <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware">the firmware</a>. Each
layout is accessible by pressing a key; something similar to pressing
alt or shift on another keyboard, where pressing these keys
allow to access a new set of symbols.
</p>

<p>
Before ordering the ErgoDox I was preparing a lot to find an optimized
layout suited for my needs. It happened that <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/">Colemak Mod-DH</a> was perfect
for me. Similarly, I wanted an optimized coder layout for my
programming needs. I used some <a href="https://github.com/kototama/keyboard-frequencies">simple Unix tools</a> to calculate the
frequencies of special symbols appearing in various source codes. I
chose projects which either I or my (ex-) colleagues worked on, having a size
bigger than 5KLOC and coming from different language families:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>one Clojure project (Lisp family)</li>
<li>one Python project (significant structural indentation)</li>
<li>one JavaScript project (curly brackets)</li>
<li>one Haskell project (ML family, Haskell, PureScript)</li>
</ul>

<p>
I aggregated various statistics and used them for <b>Manually</b> designing
the coder layout. I did not analyze my shell commands, however the
place of the slash symbol in my design allows to easily type
directory paths. I designed the layout according to an <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/compare.html">effort matrix</a>
but I did not go as far as to test my design with a software. It just
felt (very) good and I needed a fast solution to be able to use
the ErgoDox as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
It took little time to learn the layout, partly because I designed it
but also because there was no conflicting mental model in my head, unlike
when learning a new optimized layout where the brain needs to
"unlearn" the previous layout from the new one.
</p>

<p>
Symbols are balanced, as much as possible, between left and
right. "Weaker" symbols (such as "?" or ') are on the left and
"stronger" symbols ("!" or ") are on the right. I placed all
punctuation symbols on my first layer (, . ; : ) so they do not appear
on the coder layout.
</p>

<p>
In the end I think the default coder layout proposed by the ErgoDox EZ
is a very bad one considering the ergonomics. It should be seen as a
showcase of the possibilities offered by the ErgoDox and an invitation
to taylor a layout for users' needs (which is the idea of this
product).
</p>

<p>
My exact final layout can be <a href="https://github.com/kototama/qmk_firmware">found on my GitHub</a> and was not submitted
back to the original project yet, as I still want to do a few
improvements. I recreated a similar design to mine with the
configurator <a href="http://configure.ergodox-ez.com/keyboard_layouts/qdvyyr/edit">available here</a>. If you like it, I would appreciate a
short comment.
