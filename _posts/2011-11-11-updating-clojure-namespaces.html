<div class='post'>
Continuing my experimentations with Emacs Lisp, I created a function that automatically updates the namespace of a Clojure buffer in conformity with its pathname. This is useful after renaming a file, since changing a file pathname requires to change its namespace, which is sometimes annoying to do by hand. <br/><script src="https://gist.github.com/1358405.js"> </script> Once added to your .emacs file, you can call it with: <pre>M-x clojure-update-ns</pre>  <br/>It assumes clojure-mode is already loaded.</div>

Thanks! An improved version of this function, called clojure-update-ns, has been integrated into the latest clojure-mode.el, available at https://github.com/technomancy/clojure-mode</div>

Great little function - thank you!  Next step would be to create one that recursively traverses a directory applies this to every .clj file found :)</div>
