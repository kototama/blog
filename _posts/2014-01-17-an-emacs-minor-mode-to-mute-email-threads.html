Emacs is best know to be a powerful text editor. It is also a powerful note
editing system with <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>. Since emails are mostly composed of text it also
makes sense to use Emacs for reading and writing them ; automating
common tasks is possible with Emacs Lisp and taking notes and referencing
emails within org-mode is easy.
</p>

<p>
To read my emails with Emacs I use the <a href="http://notmuchmail.org/">notmuch</a> program. It indexes emails very
quickly and functions with tags. Searching is super fast, even with a
huge number of emails.
</p>

<p>
Since Emacs is almost infinitely customizable, I hacked a minor mode for notmuch
that allow me to mute email threads. You can mark a thread of emails as 'killed'
and all incoming email belonging to this thread will be automatically marked as
read upon arrival.
</p>

<p>
The mode is not very efficient for the moment but you are encouraged to try it
on your own and see if it improves your workflow.
