According to the <a href="http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Library+Coding+Standards">Clojure coding standards for libraries</a>, variables names should be written with *earmuffs* only when they are intended to be rebind. <br /><br />Here and there I forget this rule and use earmuffs most of the time, so I decided to create an Emacs Lisp function to add/remove earmuffs to variable:<br /><br /><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1331024.js"> </script><br /><br />Add it to your .emacs file and then place your cursor on a variable and call it with <pre>M-x earmuffy</pre>to add earmuffs, or type <pre>C-u M-x earmuffy</pre>to remove them.</div>

Thanks for providing a better implementation.<br /><br />I&#39;m experimenting with Emacs Lisp time to time but didn&#39;t read so much documentation about it yet so it&#39;s welcome to see improvement to my experiments.</div>

Wouldn&#39;t it be nicer to have toggle-earmuffs, which detects what you currently have and toggle it?</div>
